The Art of Innovation
By Tom Kelley

026 - It's precisely (this sort of) observation fuelled insight that makes innovation possible.Uncovering what comes naturally to people. And having the strength to change the rules.

031 - If you're not in the jungle, you're not going to know the tiger.

040 - Look at the men and women of your business who do things a little differently.

045 - Succesful innovations recognize that people don't always do the "right" thing or make the necessary leaps to bridge the gap between familiar and genuinely new ideas. Widespread adoption often takes time. Astute observation is one way to shorten that cycle and make tradeoffs that users will accept.

046 - See products as verbs - as animated devices that people integrate into their lives - and you'll become more attuned to how people use products, spaces, services - whatever you're trying to imrove.

049 - ...how even what seems like a static product can be improved if you see it in motion.

052 - If something is broken, it can be fixed. Just keep your eyes opwn for inspiration.
