Till about 3 years ago I was flirting with blockchain, mainly ethereum and also Cardano, to try to build the next big thing. I would go from tutorial to tutorial, read a few yellow papers in between to feel like an intellectual. Then the crypto bubble came in between, at first I disregarded it as it veered from the cyber punk roots and the principles of decentralization. Then I got envious of the profits the mere speculators were making. I invested some money near the peak, say some measly gains and then for a long time my portfolio had lost 60% of its value. Luckily, when i needed some money to visit Bali with my friends, my crypto portfolio was up 12%, I exited and had an amazing trip. My mostly mildly stimulating job in a big-tech firm also gave me a valid reason to stay away from tinkering with blockchains after 8 hours of "work" and anyways I was not on my way to build the next big thing so why bother. Now I'm a student yet again, and a graduate one this time, so I though why don't I try to rekindle the old love. And I decided to go back to the old websites I had visited earlier and I am taken aback by the amount of change.

I've got to start again ü§¶üèª. But let's see how this journey goes and where does it take me.
